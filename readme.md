# Overview
As a software engineer, I am continually seeking opportunities to refine 
my skills and deepen my understanding of programming languages. 
This project demonstrates a command-line calculator built in C++, showcasing 
fundamental concepts such as input handling, arithmetic operations, file I/O, and object-oriented programming.

The primary goal of this software was to create a functional calculator capable of 
performing basicarithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Additionally, the program includes features such as saving and loading calculation history, emphasizing the use of file handling in C++. 
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of C++ syntax, error handling, and class implementation.

# Development Environment
Visual Studio Code as my code editor, paired with the GCC compiler for building the program.
C++ as the programming language, leveraging its standard libraries such as <iostream>, <fstream>, <vector>, and <string>.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Include support for scientific calculations, such as trigonometry or logarithms.
- Enhance the user experience with a graphical interface instead of a command-line environment.
- Implement the ability to search or filter previous calculations from the history file.
